  A data-driven Data Science Intern at ABGi USA, I'm leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning to drive strategic decision-making. With a strong foundation from UCLA in Quantitative Economics, I specialize in building predictive models, optimizing data workflows, and developing insights through data visualization.
  <br><br>
  My experience includes leading a team at Optimas Capital to outperform market benchmarks by 17.8% through advanced machine learning models and analyzing financial datasets with over 2000 features. Additionally, I have successfully implemented revenue forecasting models that increased forecast accuracy by 20% and applied machine learning techniques to identify growth opportunities in high-performance regions.
