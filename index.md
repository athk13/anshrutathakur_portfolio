## ML Models for Quantitative Finance- Alpha Research

At Optimas Capital, a distinguished investment management firm, I analyzed a complex dataset with over 2000 financial features using PCA and machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost, developing strategies that outperformed the market benchmark by 17.8%. Our team successfully achieved the project goal of finding orthogonal alphas.

## Sentiment Analysis- Forex Trading Strategy

In this project, I developed a Forex trading strategy by conducting sentiment analysis on economic news extracted using the NY Times API, spanning 2003 to 2024, using advanced NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The strategy was optimized through backtesting and hyperparameter tuning, ultimately achieving a 1.4% annualized return, thereby outperforming the HFRI Currency Index.

## Deep NLP- Hate Speech Recognition

This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect hateful and offensive speech on social media platforms, specifically analyzing tweets from the 2020 US Elections. Using BERT, a natural language processing model, the project integrates both textual content and contextual stances towards political figures to classify tweets as either hateful or non-hateful, aiming to enhance content moderation by improving the detection accuracy of harmful online behavior.
